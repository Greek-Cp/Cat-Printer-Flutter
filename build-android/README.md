# Build for Android

The build environment shall be setup manually, since it’s a bit complex, and I’m not so familiar with Android development.

See [Manual Steps](./manual-steps.md) to get started.

Android enthusiasts may help with automated build procedure, then for example F-Droid release would be possible.
